//bootstrap Type System

//: Three Introduction Rules
//: I1. ascription proves implication
forall M: Metric. M => Metric

//: I2. ascription proves conditional type equation
forall X:Integer,D:Dimension. (Dimension,Integer)

//: I3. quantification proves relational type equation
forall A,B. (A,B)

//: Implication Reduction is Strongly Normalizing
//:
//: 1) All types that strongly normalize have kinds
//: 2) All kinds that have types yield values
//: 3) All finite-length strings are finite-length

//: Three Elimination Rules
//: E1. 3 implies 2
forall AB1. (A,B,1) => (A,B) yields { 1 A B }

//: E2. 4 implies 3
forall AB12. (A,B,1,2) => (A,B,1) yields { 1 2 A B }

//: E3 5 implies 4 if (x,0)
forall AB12x. (A,B,1,2,x) => (A,B,1,2) yields { 0 1 2 A B }

//: goal, prove all statements assuming (x,0)
