//bootstrap Type System

//: ascript implies
forall D,M: Metric. M => D

//: ascripted type equation
forall X:Integer,D:Dimension. (Dimension,Integer)

//: fully-quantified type equation
forall 1D,2D. (1D,2D)

//: Implication Reduction is Strongly Normalizing

//: All types that strongly normalize have kinds
//: All kinds that have types yield values
forall AB1, (A,1) -> B. (A1,B2) => C3 yields { A B 1 }

//: All finite-length strings are finite-length
//: coincidentally this is exactly the definition of a transistor
forall AB1. (A,B,1) yields 1 A B
forall AB12. (A,B,1,2) yields 1 2 A B
forall AB12x. (A,B,1,2,x) yields 1 2 A B 0
