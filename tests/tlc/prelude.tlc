//bootstrap Type System

//: ascription proves implication
forall M: Metric. M => Metric

//: conditional type equation proves ascription
forall X:Integer,D:Dimension. (Dimension,Integer)

//: fully-quantified type equation proves relation
forall A,B. (A,B)

//: Implication Reduction is Strongly Normalizing

//: All types that strongly normalize have kinds
//: All kinds that have types yield values
//: All finite-length strings are finite-length
forall AB1. (A,B,1) => (A,B) yields { 1 A B }
forall AB12. (A,B,1,2) => (A,B,1) yields { 1 2 A B }
forall AB12x. (A,B,1,2,x) => (A,B,1,2) yields { 0 1 2 A B }

//: goal, prove all statements assuming (x,0)
